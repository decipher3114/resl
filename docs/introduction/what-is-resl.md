# 🤔 What is RESL?

**RESL** = **R**untime **E**valuated **S**erialization **L**anguage

RESL is a modern configuration and serialization language with variables, expressions, and dynamic runtime evaluation designed to solve the limitations of traditional static configuration formats like JSON.

::: info PRONUNCIATION
**RESL** is pronounced like _"wrestle"_
:::

## 🎯 Core Purpose

RESL is designed to bring programming capabilities to config files, eliminating the common problems of repetitive, verbose, and hard-to-maintain configuration files.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🔄 Dynamic Configuration**: Variables, functions, and computed values
- **📝 Familiar Syntax**: Combines the best of JSON, JavaScript, and functional programming
- **🏗️ Flexible Structure**: Any expression can be top-level, not just objects
- **📊 Rich Data Types**: Strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and maps
- **⚡ Powerful Operations**: Binary operations, conditionals, transformations, and more

## 🎯 Use Cases

RESL is ideal for:

- **Application Configuration**: Server settings, database connections, feature flags
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Kubernetes manifests, Docker configurations, CI/CD pipelines
- **Dynamic Configurations**: Environment-specific settings, computed values, conditional logic
- **Data Generation**: Test data, mock configurations, templated content
- **API Responses**: Dynamic JSON generation with computed fields

## 💡 Philosophy

RESL follows the principle that configuration should be:

- **Expressive** without being complex
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** through variables and functions
- **Maintainable** with clear structure and computed values
- **Familiar** using syntax patterns developers already know
- **Efficient** producing smaller, more readable files
