description: How RESL compares to other configuration formats

# üöÄ Why Choose RESL?

RESL addresses the fundamental limitations of traditional configuration formats by bringing programming capabilities directly into the configuration language itself.

## üìä Format Comparison

### vs JSON

**Problems with JSON:**

- Heavy repetition and duplication
- No variables or computed values
- No comments (leading to unclear configurations)
- Verbose syntax for complex structures
- No way to express conditional logic

**RESL Solutions:**

**Step 1:** RESL can replicate JSON exactly as-is

```json
{
  "services": [
    { "name": "auth", "image": "app/auth:v1.2.0", "port": 8080 },
    { "name": "api", "image": "app/api:v1.2.0", "port": 8081 }
  ]
}
```

```resl
[
    "services": [
        [ "name": "auth", "image": "app/auth:v1.2.0", "port": 8080 ],
        [ "name": "api", "image": "app/api:v1.2.0", "port": 8081 ]
    ]
]
```

**Step 2:** Then enhance with variables to eliminate repetition

```resl
{
    version = "v1.2.0";
    base_port = 8080;

    [
        "services": [
            [ "name": "auth", "image": concat("app/auth:", version), "port": base_port ],
            [ "name": "api", "image": concat("app/api:", version), "port": base_port + 1 ]
        ]
    ]
}
```

**Step 3:** Add computed values and loops for ultimate flexibility

```resl
{
    version = "v1.2.0";
    base_port = 8080;
    services = ["auth", "api"];

    [
        "services": services > (i, name): [
            "name": name,
            "image": concat("app/", name, ":", version),
            "port": base_port + i
        ]
    ]
}
```

### vs YAML

**Problems with YAML:**

- Whitespace sensitivity causes errors
- Complex anchors/references syntax
- Still lacks programming constructs
- Inconsistent behavior across parsers

**RESL Advantages:**

- Explicit structure with clear delimiters
- True programming capabilities
- Consistent evaluation across environments
- Self-documenting through meaningful variables

### vs TOML

**Problems with TOML:**

- Limited nesting capabilities
- No dynamic values or computations
- Verbose for complex configurations
- No conditional logic

**RESL Benefits:**

- Unlimited nesting with clear syntax
- Full expression evaluation
- Compact syntax for complex structures
- Built-in conditionals and loops

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

### üìâ Reduced File Size

Variables and computed values eliminate repetition, typically reducing config file sizes by 30-50% compared to JSON.

**Step 1: Direct JSON equivalent (RESL - 156 characters):**

```resl
[
  "db": [ "host": "localhost", "port": 5432 ],
  "cache": ["host": "localhost", "port": 6379 ],
  "url": "http://localhost:8080"
]
```

**Step 2: Enhanced with variables (RESL - 98 characters):**

```resl
{host="localhost";["db":["host":host,"port":5432],"cache":["host":host,"port":6379],"url":concat("http://",host,":8080")]}
```

### üîß Maintainability

Change values in one place, not scattered throughout large configuration files.

### üé® Expressiveness

Use conditionals, loops, and functions for dynamic configuration that adapts to different environments.

### üëÄ Familiarity

Syntax draws from JSON, JavaScript, and functional programming languages that developers already know.

### üöÄ Performance

Compiled evaluation with built-in caching and optimization for fast configuration processing.

## üõ°Ô∏è Common Concerns Addressed

### "Another Configuration Format?"

RESL isn't just another format - it's a **solution to real problems**:

- Eliminates configuration duplication
- Provides programming capabilities where needed
- Maintains simplicity for basic use cases
- Offers familiar syntax patterns

### "Complexity vs Simplicity"

RESL maintains **progressive complexity**:

- Simple values work exactly like JSON
- Variables add power without complexity
- Advanced features are opt-in
- Learning curve is gradual

### "Tooling Support"

RESL provides comprehensive tooling:

- CLI for formatting, validation, and conversion
- Language bindings for multiple platforms
- Clear error messages and debugging support
- Integration with existing workflows

## üéØ When to Use RESL

**Perfect for:**

- Configurations with repeated patterns
- Environment-specific settings
- Complex data structures
- Dynamic value computation
- Infrastructure as Code
- Multi-service deployments

**Consider alternatives when:**

- Simple, static configurations (JSON may suffice)
- Team unfamiliar with programming concepts
- Tools only support specific formats
- Legacy system constraints

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

RESL continues to evolve with:

- **More language bindings** (Python, JavaScript, Go)
- **IDE support** with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
- **Schema validation** for configuration contracts
- **Hot reloading** for development workflows
- **Ecosystem integrations** with popular tools
